## About Alchenne

### Description:
|<img src="/readme/bg.png">|
| :---------------------------------: |
| The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. The game provides multiple skills that the player can develop during gameplay. One of them is Alchemy, a skill that takes time to increase due to the constant search for specific ingredients and their possible effects. This is where Alchenne comes in, an application that serves as a source of information about potions, effects, ingredients and their locations. |

### Functionalities:
* Show all Alchemy ingredients.
* Show all Alchemy effects.
* Search bar for effects and ingredients.
* Favourites Tab for your favourites ingredients and effects.
* Potion Maker.

Developed in Python and deployed in Heroku, it is divided into 4 parts. Two GET methods, one for obtaining all the ingredients and the other for the effects.
